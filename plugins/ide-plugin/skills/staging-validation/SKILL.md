# /project:staging-validation

**Interactive Staging Environment Testing & Sign-Off**

Works in: Cursor IDE chat + Claude Code + CLI

## Usage

```
/project:staging-validation AB#123
/project:staging-validation AB#123 --scope=sit

3. **Executes test suite** (unit, integration, E2E)
4. **Monitors stability** (error rates, latency)
5. **Collects sign-off** from QA and product
6. **Creates validation report** for release readiness
