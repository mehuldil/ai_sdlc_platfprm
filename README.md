## The problem

Every engineering team using AI today runs into the same wall:

- **Fragmented prompts** — every engineer has their own AI workflow, nothing is shared
- **Zero traceability** — a PR ships and nobody can trace it back to a requirement
- **"Release readiness" is tribal knowledge** — it lives in 2 people's heads
- **Governance is either absent or a bottleneck** — AI acts without human approval, or gates are so heavy nobody uses them
- **New engineers take weeks to onboard** — because "how we work here" isn't written down

**AI moves fast. Process doesn't keep up. Quality suffers.**

---

## Why AI-SDLC Platform

> **One CLI. Every team. Every IDE. Full traceability. Humans stay in control.**

| Without AI-SDLC | With AI-SDLC |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Every team invents their own AI workflow | Shared stages, agents, skills, and rules — one playbook |
| Traceability is manual and often missing | PRD → Master Story → Sprint → Task → Branch → PR → ADO — automatic chain |
| Onboarding a new engineer takes weeks | `sdlc doctor` + offline User Manual — productive from day 1 |
| Quality gates are informal | Pre-commit hooks, rules, and template DoD enforce quality at the right moments |
| AI makes changes without asking | **Ask-first protocol** — AI proposes, human approves every gate and destructive action |
| Token costs are unpredictable | Budget per role, visible via `sdlc tokens`, module slices cut waste |

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER/ai_sdlc_platform.git
cd ai_sdlc_platform

./setup.sh /path/to/your/project   # or just ./setup.sh for in-repo use
sdlc doctor                        # verify hooks and health

sdlc use backend --stack=java  # pick your role and stack
sdlc context                       # confirm current state
sdlc run 05-system-design          # jump into any stage
```

**IDE integration — zero extra config after setup:**

| Interface | How |
|-----------|-----|
| **Cursor** | Use `/project:*` slash commands; rules auto-load from `.cursor/rules/` |
| **Claude Code** | Skills and rules available via `.claude/` symlinks |
| **Terminal** | Full `sdlc` CLI — same commands everywhere |

## Features

### 15-stage pipeline with smart routing

A numbered, named stage for every phase — intake through post-release close. Smart routing skips unnecessary stages based on change type, so a config change doesn't run the full 15-stage gauntlet.

| Route | Stages | Use case |
|-------|--------|----------|
| `NEW_FEATURE` | All 15 | New capability end-to-end |
| `BUG_FIX` | ~10 | Fix with full test cycle |
| `HOTFIX` | ~4 | Critical fix, fast path |
| `CONFIG_CHANGE` | ~5 | Env vars, feature flags |
| `REFACTOR` | ~10 | Quality work, behavior unchanged |

### 4-tier story pipeline with full traceability

```
PRD → Master Story → Sprint Story → Tech Task → Branch → PR → ADO Work Item
```

```bash
sdlc story create sprint   # scaffold a sprint story from template
sdlc story validate        # check AC format, traceability
sdlc story push            # push to Azure DevOps as linked work item
```

### Ask-first protocol

**AI never acts without asking.** Every destructive action, state change, and gate transition requires explicit human approval. Not as a block — as a habit.

```
AI: "I plan to modify 3 files for US-1234:
     1. UserService.java — add validation
     2. UserController.java — new endpoint  
     3. api.yaml — update contract schema
     Proceed?  (1) Yes  (2) Edit plan  (3) Cancel"
```

### RPI workflow (Research → Plan → Implement → Verify)

For changes touching multiple files, the platform enforces a serialized workflow with human approval at each phase — no silent rewrites.

```bash
sdlc run 08-implementation   # triggers RPI loop for the current task
```

### Repo-grounded design

Design and implementation stay **anchored to real artifacts**, not abstract bullets:

- Design template **§0** captures existing paths, contracts, and backward-compatibility risks before any code is written
- Module knowledge (`.sdlc/module/`) refreshed with `sdlc module update .`; loaded efficiently with `sdlc module load api` (not the whole tree)
- Rules enforce **regression-aware** testing at implementation complete (`rules/repo-grounded-change.md`)

### Module system (token-efficient context)

```bash
sdlc module init .                    # generate module knowledge for your app repo
sdlc module show                      # compact overview
sdlc module load api|data|events|logic # load only the slice you need
sdlc module validate                  # check for breaking changes before merge
```

### Git hooks (quality at commit-time)

22 hooks covering: secrets detection, commit message format, documentation sync, token budget checks, module contract validation, **semantic memory sync**, and **pre-merge test enforcement**. Issues caught at commit — not at PR review.

**Semantic Memory Hooks:**
- `semantic-memory-pre-commit.sh` — Exports active semantic memory to JSONL for team sync
- `semantic-memory-post-merge.sh` — Imports team semantic memory after pull/merge

**Pre-merge Test Enforcement:**
- `pre-merge-test-enforcement.md` — Policy requiring tests to pass before merge (with structured bypass via `sdlc skip-tests`)
- `test-bypass-escalation.sh` — Escalation workflow for test bypass approval

### Advisory gates (inform, don't block)

10 quality gates. All advisory. AI validates evidence and surfaces findings. Humans decide to proceed, fix, skip, or pause. No bottlenecks; full audit trail.

## Design principles

1. **Atomic skills, thin agents** — skills have single responsibility; agents compose them, never duplicate logic
2. **Ask-first** — AI proposes, humans decide; no silent production actions ever
3. **Gates inform, don't block** — advisory checkpoints with justifiable skip; not bottlenecks
4. **Repo-grounded** — work anchors to real files, contracts, and tests; not abstract descriptions
5. **Token-aware** — smart context loading per stage; sliced module access; budget per role
6. **Single source of truth** — one `User_Manual/`, one CLI, one registry per asset type

#### Automatic Documentation Updates

The platform includes **git hooks** that automatically regenerate `User_Manual/manual.html` whenever documentation files change. No manual intervention needed.

**Setup hooks (one-time):**
```bash
# Linux/Mac:
bash hooks/setup-hooks.sh

# Windows:
setup-hooks.cmd
```

**How it works:**
- **Pre-commit hook** — Detects changes to `User_Manual/*.md`, `docs/*.md`, `rules/*.md`, `skills/*.md`, `agents/*.md`, `stages/*.md`, or `templates/*.md` and auto-regenerates `manual.html` before every commit
- **Pre-push hook** — Verifies `manual.html` is current before allowing push to remote (blocks push if outdated)

**Manual regeneration** (if needed):
```bash
node User_Manual/build-manual-html.mjs
```

## Extensibility

No platform rewrites. Add capabilities by following existing patterns:

| Add | What to create | Also update |
|-----|---------------|-------------|
| New role | `roles/` + `agents/` folder | `agent-registry.json`, relevant stages |
| New skill | `skills/<role>/<skill>/SKILL.md` | `skills/SKILL.md` registry |
| New stack | `stacks/<stack>/` conventions | `cli/lib/config.sh` |
| New stage | `stages/<n>-name/STAGE.md` | Routing + adjacent stages |
| New rule | `rules/<rule>.md` | `rules/README.md` index |

## Contributing

1. Fork and create a feature branch
2. For changes touching multiple files, follow the **RPI workflow** and **repo-grounded rules**
3. Run `sdlc doctor` before submitting
4. Open a PR — commit messages and traceability matter (see `rules/commit-conventions.md`)

All contributions pass pre-commit hooks: secrets detection, commit format, documentation sync.
