# 🏗️ Tech Story — [Component / Service / Flow Name]

> **Single source of truth (implementation):** This document is the **authoritative technical spec for build and review**. It must be **grounded in fact**—repository structure, existing APIs, approved **system design**, **Master Story**, and **Sprint Story**—not speculative architecture.
>
> **No guesses:** If a fact is unknown, use `USER_INPUT_REQUIRED` (see [STORY_TEMPLATE_REGISTRY.md](STORY_TEMPLATE_REGISTRY.md)). Do **not** invent endpoints, schemas, SLAs, or dependencies.
>
> **Non-regression:** New behavior must be **explicitly safe** for existing users, APIs, jobs, and data. Call out **what must not change** and how you **prove** it (tests, flags, contracts).

## 📚 Inputs & source of truth *(required)*

**Every technical claim should trace** to one of: **system design** (section/figure), **Master/Sprint story**, **existing code/module**, or **observed runtime**—or be marked `USER_INPUT_REQUIRED`.

| Source | Link / ADO id / repo path | Revision (commit, date, or doc version) | Sections / ACs used |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **System design** (primary) | | | e.g. §3.2, Fig. 4 |
| **Master Story** | | | Outcome / capabilities / 📎 PRD lift |
| **Sprint Story** | | | Scope, ACs, 📎 sprint lift |
| **Repo / module map** | e.g. `.sdlc/module/` or `docs/architecture` | | |

---

## 🧱 Baseline: existing system *(required — evidence-based)*

**Purpose:** Describe **today’s** behavior so the team knows **what must keep working**. Prefer **code anchors** and **facts** over narrative.

- **Services / modules involved:** [Names; link packages or top-level dirs]
- **Current behavior (as-is):** [What users/systems experience today—in **short** bullets]
- **Existing contracts:** [REST/queue events/schemas consumers rely on—cite file or OpenAPI path]
- **Known constraints:** [DB, rate limits, idempotency, ordering—**from design or code**]
- **Repo anchors** (extend table as needed):

| Path, package, or service | Role today (read / extend / must not break) |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| | |

---

## 🎯 Technical goal & delta *(required)*

**What changes** relative to the baseline—**one paragraph max**, then bullets.

- **Delta:** [New capability or change—tied to Sprint/Master scope]
- **Out of scope (technical):** [What this tech story explicitly does **not** change]
- **Performance / reliability targets:** [Only if stated in design or Sprint/Master—else `USER_INPUT_REQUIRED`]

---

## 📐 Alignment with system design *(required)*

- **Design sections / diagrams:** [List § and fig refs this work implements]
- **Consistency:** [How this matches the design—same components, same boundaries]
- **Deviation:** [If implementation differs from design] → **ADR link** or decision record + approver *(no silent drift)*

---

## 🔀 Change impact & blast radius *(required)*

**Purpose:** Who and what is affected—**functional** and **technical**.

| Area | Impact | Owner / note |
|------|--------|----------------|
| APIs / events | [New/changed/deprecated] | |
| Data stores | [Migration, backfill, new indexes] | |
| Jobs / async | [New consumers, topic changes] | |
| Clients (apps, BFFs) | [Contract changes] | |
| Observability | [New metrics/logs] | |

- **Dependencies:** [Upstream/downstream systems; **blocking** items]
- **Rollback data risk:** [None / low / high + mitigation]

---

## 🛡️ Non-regression, compatibility & “do not break” *(required)*

**Purpose:** Implementation must **not** break existing functionality unless an **explicit** deprecation path is approved.

- **Must remain true (invariants):** [Bullets—e.g. “Existing GET `/x` response shape unchanged for v1 clients”]
- **Backward compatibility:** [API versioning, feature flags, dual-write period, default-off behavior]
- **Contract / regression checks:** [What stays green—e.g. “existing integration test suite `…`”, “consumer contract tests for …”]
- **Feature flags / kill switches:** [If used—name, default, rollout tie-in]

---

## 🏛️ Architecture & implementation approach

### Design *(grounded)*

- **Approach:** [Queue + worker, new service, extension point—**aligned with design doc**]
- **Components:** [New vs modified—name them]
- **Data flow:** [Request/event → processing → persistence → response]
- **Failure modes:** [Degrade paths; idempotency]

### Technology & integration *(optional but cite sources)*

- **Persistence / messaging / cache:** [Only if in scope—match design or repo standards]
- **Integration points:** [Upstream/downstream; **versioning**]

### Repo anchors *(update before merge)*

| Path or package | Change (add / modify / replace) |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| | |
